The compare() function accepts two arguments a and b. 
The sort() method will sort elements based on the return value of the compare() function with the following rules:

1. If compare(a,b) is less than zero, the sort() method sorts a to a lower index than b. 
In other words, a will come first.
2. If compare(a,b) is greater than zero, the sort() method sort b to a lower index than a, 
i.e., b will come first.
3. If compare(a,b) returns zero, 
the sort() method considers a equals b and leaves their positions unchanged.
